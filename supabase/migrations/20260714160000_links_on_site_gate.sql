-- Wake the dormant `links.on_site` column: gate the links branch of
-- get_public_site on it.
--
-- The column was added in 20260708150000 alongside tracks.on_site, but only
-- tracks was ever wired (20260710170000). links has been inert on BOTH ends
-- since: get_public_site's links branch had no filter, and nothing in the UI
-- wrote the flag either — setOnSiteAction's ON_SITE_TABLE listed `link` but the
-- editor only ever called it for photos and songs. So the column existed,
-- defaulted true, and did nothing. It described a feature that wasn't there.
--
-- This migration + the accompanying editor toggle make it real: a manager can
-- take a link off the site the same way they already can a song.
--
-- Follows the TRACKS model, not the merch/video one. Links are toggled LIVE
-- (setOnSiteAction) rather than reconciled from a selection at publish time, so
-- `link` stays out of ON_SITE_ENTITIES/reconcileOnSite — exactly like tracks.
--
-- LEFT JOIN + coalesce(l.on_site, true), matching every other gated branch (the
-- convention 20260707200000 set): the published snapshot stays authoritative
-- until a real publish tombstones it, so deleting a working row doesn't yank
-- live content early. Defaulting to true also means the cutover is a no-op —
-- every existing link stays on the site until someone deliberately toggles it.
--
-- Everything else is unchanged from 20260714150000.
